# Multimodal Master – Visual and Document Analysis System

This project demonstrates advanced prompt engineering for handling non-text inputs, proving the ability to integrate visual and document processing into automated workflows.

## Use Case: UI/UX to Code Conversion
This system takes a screenshot of a simple website component (e.g., a login form or navigation bar) and generates the clean HTML/CSS/JS code needed to replicate it, while also providing UX recommendations.

## Results Showcase
| Input Type | Output Quality | Business Value |
|---|---|---|
| UI Screenshot | 90% accurate HTML/CSS code | Eliminates front-end development boilerplate (saving 1-2 hours) |
| Complex PDF/Diagram | Accurate summary and data extraction | 10x speed on document review and data scraping |

**This repository proves mastery of file processing (Module 17) and code generation (Module 19) from my PromptVault Pro (link to be added later).**
